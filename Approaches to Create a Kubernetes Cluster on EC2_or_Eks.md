# Approaches to Create a Kubernetes Cluster on EC2/EKS

When setting up a Kubernetes cluster (for example, on AWS EC2 or EKS), there are **four main approaches**:

1. Manual Approach
2. CLI Approach
3. Terraform Approach
4. Python Bot Approach

---

## 1. Manual Approach (Console / Click-Ops)

**Description:**
Using the AWS Console (or another provider’s UI) to create all resources manually (VPC, subnets, EC2/EKS, node groups, security groups, etc.).

**Steps:**

* Create VPC → subnets → Internet Gateway / NAT → route tables.
* Create an EKS cluster (or EC2 + kubeadm cluster).
* Add worker nodes.
* Download and update `~/.kube/config`.
* Verify connectivity:

  ```bash
  kubectl get nodes
  ```

**Pros:**

* Easy to start.
* Visual and beginner-friendly.

**Cons:**

* Not repeatable.
* Error-prone.
* No version control.

**Use Case:**

* Learning or one-time demo setups.

---

## 2. CLI Approach (Scripted Commands)

**Description:**
Using command-line tools such as `awscli`, `eksctl`, `kubectl`, and `helm` in shell scripts.

**Example:**

```bash
# Create cluster with eksctl
eksctl create cluster --name demo --region ap-south-1 --nodes 2

# Verify cluster
kubectl get nodes
```

**Pros:**

* Quick and repeatable with scripts.
* Easy to integrate into CI/CD pipelines.

**Cons:**

* Harder to manage drift.
* Logic scattered in scripts.

**Use Case:**

* Small teams, simple environments, CI jobs.

---

## 3. Terraform Approach (Infrastructure as Code)

**Description:**
Define the infrastructure in declarative `.tf` files. Terraform manages state, drift detection, and reproducibility.

**Example:**

```hcl
provider "aws" { region = "ap-south-1" }

module "vpc" {
  source = "terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws"
  name   = "demo"
  cidr   = "10.0.0.0/16"
  azs    = ["ap-south-1a","ap-south-1b"]
  public_subnets  = ["10.0.1.0/24","10.0.2.0/24"]
  private_subnets = ["10.0.3.0/24","10.0.4.0/24"]
}

module "eks" {
  source          = "terraform-aws-modules/eks/aws"
  cluster_name    = "demo"
  cluster_version = "1.29"
  vpc_id          = module.vpc.vpc_id
  subnet_ids      = module.vpc.private_subnets
}
```

**Commands:**

```bash
terraform init
terraform apply -auto-approve

aws eks update-kubeconfig --name demo --region ap-south-1
kubectl get nodes
```

**Pros:**

* Reproducible, version-controlled.
* Good for multi-environment setups.
* Manages drift and dependencies.

**Cons:**

* Steeper learning curve.
* Requires managing state files.

**Use Case:**

* Teams, multiple environments (dev/stage/prod), compliance-heavy workflows.

---

## 4. Python Bot Approach (SDK Automation)

**Description:**
Use Python (with `boto3` or other SDKs) to programmatically create clusters and automate workflows.

**Example:**

```python
import boto3

eks = boto3.client("eks", region_name="ap-south-1")

eks.create_cluster(
  name="demo",
  version="1.29",
  roleArn="arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/EKSClusterRole",
  resourcesVpcConfig={
      "subnetIds": ["subnet-abc", "subnet-def"]
  }
)

print("Cluster creation initiated...")
```

**Pros:**

* Highly customizable logic.
* Can integrate approvals, workflows, or multi-cloud automation.
* Good for building automation bots.

**Cons:**

* More code to maintain.
* No built-in state management (unless combined with Terraform).

**Use Case:**

* Self-service portals, advanced automation, multi-cloud orchestration.

## Quick Comparison

| Approach       | Pros                                     | Cons                              | Best For                         |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Manual**     | Easy, visual, good for learning          | Error-prone, not repeatable       | Learning, demos                  |
| **CLI**        | Fast, scriptable, CI-friendly            | Limited drift mgmt, messy scripts | Small setups, CI jobs            |
| **Terraform**  | Declarative, reproducible, team-friendly | State mgmt, learning curve        | Multi-env, production            |
| **Python Bot** | Custom workflows, flexible SDK           | More code, must handle state      | Self-service, complex automation |

## 10-Second Interview Summary

> “We can provision clusters in four ways: **Manual** (simple, not repeatable), **CLI** (scripted, fast), **Terraform** (declarative IaC, best for teams), and **Python bot** (custom workflows using SDKs). I prefer **Terraform for stable infra** and use **Python/CLI for workflows and automation glue**.”

Would you like me to also add a **diagram (ASCII or Mermaid)** in this `.md` that shows how each approach flows (Manual → Console, CLI → eksctl, Terraform → IaC, Python Bot → boto3)?
