In a Deployment manifest, everything you listed falls under the top-level spec: block of the Deployment.

Hereâ€™s the structure (simplified tree view):

ðŸ”‘ Key thing to remember:

The outer spec: belongs to the Deployment (defines replicas, selector, and pod template).

The inner spec: (under template) belongs to the Pod (defines containers, images, resources, volumes, etc.).

ðŸ‘‰ Trainer tip: Think of it as nested specs:

Deployment spec â†’ "How many Pods do I want and how to manage them?"

Pod spec (inside template) â†’ "Whatâ€™s inside each Pod?"
